# Journal Tools

I record a lot of audio journals, and this is what I use to deal with them.  
Right now this isn't fit to be used by anyone but me, but I'm working on making
more useable for others. Documentation and other things aimed at usability will
be coming (eventually).

Right now, it can do this:
 * Read date and time from filename, and move files to appropriate folder
 * Rename files to a standard format based on datetime
 * Add tags, quotes and notes to each file and store it in a tags.json file
 * View multiple files at once, and search for keywords
 * keep track of what tags are said when, and jump to the specified times
